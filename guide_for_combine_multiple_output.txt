Combine multiple Jetson Nano VOC XML Data together
This Python program combines multiple Jetson Nano VOC XML data into a single file. The combined file can be used for training object detection models.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or later
argparse module
os module
shutil module


Usage
Prepare your data by creating separate directories for each dataset that you want to combine. Each directory should contain the following subdirectories:

Annotations: This directory should contain XML files that describe the objects in your images.
ImageSets/Main: This directory should contain TXT files that specify which images should be used for training, testing, validation, and so on. The TXT files should be named train.txt, test.txt, trainval.txt, and val.txt.
JPEGImages: This directory should contain the images that correspond to the XML files in the Annotations directory.

Run the program with the following command:

livecodeserver

python combine_jetson_nano_voc_xml_data_txt_files.py <path_to_directory_containing_subdirectories>
```
Replace `<path_to_directory_containing_subdirectories>` with the path to the directory that contains the subdirectories described in step 1.

The program will create a new directory called combined_file in the same directory as the input directory. The combined_file directory will contain the combined XML and TXT files.

Example
Suppose you have the following directory structure:

reasonml

data
├── dataset1
│   ├── Annotations
│   ├── ImageSets
│   │   └── Main
│   ├── JPEGImages
│   └── README.txt
├── dataset2
│   ├── Annotations
│   ├── ImageSets
│   │   └── Main
│   ├── JPEGImages
│   └── README.txt
└── combine_jetson_nano_voc_xml_data_txt_files.py

To combine the two datasets, run the following command:

haskell

python combine_multiple_output.py data
The program will create a new directory called combined_file in the data directory. The combined_file directory will contain the combined XML and TXT files for both datasets.
